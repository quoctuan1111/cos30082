# Machine Learning Final Assignment (COS30082 – Applied Machine Learning)

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Main Components
- Performed **data cleaning**, **EDA**, feature engineering, and applied scaling/encoding to prepare the dataset.  
- Built and compared multiple ML models, including:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - k-NN  
  - Decision Trees  
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-score  
  - Confusion Matrix  
- Visualized dataset patterns and model performance using **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**.  
- Identified the best-performing model and analyzed feature contribution & error behavior.  
- Documented the full ML pipeline, results, and insights in a structured Jupyter Notebook.
